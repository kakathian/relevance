Problem: Currently users of content managment systems (Document based CMS) have to open, 
preview and go through the whole file to understand what the document is all about.
Peeking into 'N' number of files and going through the document could be time-consuming.

Proposed Solution:
-Show quick-summary of all documents hosted in CMS which will help users to quickly learn what 
is the document all about even without opening / peeking 

-Search queries could be more intelligent  which could use a search query similar to 'natural language' using this summary

-Helps legal, insurance, accounting departments where they wanted to collect information from various documents quickly

-This summary also helps to establish network / relations (similar to "friend of friend" networks ) between different documents. 
For example, a document with 'Sales Document' can be networked / related to 'Revenues Document'

- All documents related / connected to the selected document are shown to the user

Limitations:
At present this is under its primitive stage where the all documents considered as test subjects are flat text files.
This could be extended to include spreadsheets and windows documents in future
